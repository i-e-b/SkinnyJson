SkinnyJson
==========
Based on FastJson: http://fastjson.codeplex.com/

SkinnyJson has a cleaned-up interface, and handles interface based serialisation much better.
SkinnyJson was designed to handle Event Store messages, and is tuned to deal with situations where a common interface declaration is available, but the original serialised objects are not available.
